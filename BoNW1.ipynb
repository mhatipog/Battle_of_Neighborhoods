        "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism was a booming sector across the globe. Also after the pandemy, it is expected to recover. Because people are curious about seeing places, doing new things, experiencing different cultures, and last but not least, trying out different local cuisines. \n",
        "\n",
        "The search of new tastes drives people to tourism and the touristic sector, for example the marketing department of a tourism agency can think of mapping out the similarities/differences between the different local cuisines in the world. Which cuisine is truly unique? Which countries have similar cuisines? The answers to these questions can form the basis of a marketing argument and is already interesting on its own.\n",

        "Therefore, the primary target audience of this project are the companies and government agencies with an interest of having a great restart of the touristic sector after the pandemy. In the second place, the project also targets the attention of people seeking to try new cuisines, as a help to guide them towards a destination with tastes they haven't tasted before.\n",
